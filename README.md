# Put What Where?
This is our project for the H2024 course *Multimodal User Interfaces*, given at the University of Fribourg.

The project is an adaptation of the classic *Put That There*, where gestures have been replaced with eye gaze.

## Install project
To install the project, follow these instructions:
1. Clone this repository to your computer (or pull, if you already have cloned the project)
2. Make sure to have Python (version >=3.10) installed properly
3. Open a terminal
4. Navigate your directory to `.../MMI_put_what_where`
5. Run `pip install -e .`
   - The `-e` flag installs the project in editor mode, so you can change the source code (within the `MMI_project` folder)
   without having to re-install. If you don't intend to edit anything, running `pip install .` should be sufficient.
   - `.` refers to your current working directory.

You should now have the project installed.
