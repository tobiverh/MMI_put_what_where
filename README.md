# Put What Where?
This is our project for the H2024 course *Multimodal User Interfaces*, given at the University of Fribourg.

The project is an adaptation of the classic *Put That There*, where gestures have been replaced with eye gaze.

## Install project
To install the project, follow these instructions:
1. Clone this repository to your computer (or pull, if you already have cloned the project) 
1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate your directory to `.../MMI_put_what_where`
3. Run `pip install -e .`
   - The `-e` flag installs the project in editor mode, so you can change the source code (within the `MMI_project` folder)
   without having to re-install. If you don't intend to edit anything, running `pip install .` should be sufficient.
   - `.` refers to your current working directory.
   - Running `pip` won't work if you don't have pip installed. Make sure to have Python, version 3.4 or newer, installed properly on your computer. pip is then automatically included.

You should now have the project installed.
