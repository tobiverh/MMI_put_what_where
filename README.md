# Install project
To install the project, follow these instructions:
1. Clone this repository to your computer. 
1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate your directory to `.../MMI_put_what_where`
3. Run `pip install -e .`
   - The `-e` flag installs the project in editor mode, so you can change the source code (within the `MMI_project` folder)
   without having to re-install. If you don't intend to edit anything, running `pip install .` should be sufficient.
   - `.` refers to your current working directory.
   - Running `pip` won't work if you don't have Python installed properly on your computer

You should now have the project installed.
